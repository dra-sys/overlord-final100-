					<div class="textmargin1">	
					In 2126, a Full-Dive Massively multiplayer online role-playing game or DMMORPG called YGGDRASIL was released, standing out among all other DMMORPGs due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. 
						After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. 
						Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. 
						Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal Lich "Overlord" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick.
						 In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. 
						While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.

							<h3 align="center">Preview on novel volume 1</h3>
							 What is so brilliant about Overlord Volume 1 though is that it is simultaneously high-tech and yet imbued with magic. Science fiction books usually fall somewhere between technology and magic.
							 Many books need to choose between one or the other, or get very creative to genuinely capture both sides of the spectrum. 
                             Overlord Volume 1 is one of those abnormal but beautiful books that manage to fully indulge sci-fi readers to the fullest. Magic is clearly used throughout the world Momonga finds himself in, but he is in a game world.
                             Therefore, he is only in that magic world due to incredible gaming technology that has yet to be created (in our time at least). Momonga will use spells, then pivot and use gaming/technology words like “NPC” (non-player character) as though it is nothing. 
                             This implementation feels very natural and unforced. In addition, for any gamers, all of the terms and tactics make sense. And for those who are not familiar with gamer lingo, that is fine. 
                             Overlord Volume 1 is very kind to newcomers. It will state directly what NPC means without having to open a web browser. In addition, due to the context of a situation it is easy to understand what is going on.
