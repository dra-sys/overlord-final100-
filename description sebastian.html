							-Sebas Tian is an unarmed combat specialist and one of the four strongest warriors (Cocytus, Albedo, and Rubedo) within the Great Tomb of Nazarick. 
							If he reveals his true form (Dragonoid) in combat, 
							Sebas can even overwhelm Albedo and Cocytus.[1] According to Ainz Ooal Gown, Sebas is capable of sweeping away anyone before him in direct combat.
                            Befitting his status as a melee fighter, Sebas has high-level physical abilities and is able to perform incredible feats of strength in comparison to the New World humans. 
							In fact, his immense strength makes anything in the New World akin to paper. This and his skill in information gathering make some New World denizens, like Climb, 
							pondered if Sebas was a retired Adamantite Ranked Adventurer given the skill and strength he demonstrated.
		      <H2 align="center">Skills</H2>
			<ul>
<li> Healing: Using Ki to heal a target. However, it cannot cure diseases and poison.
<li>	Heel Drop Kick: Sebas raises one of his legs high into the air before shortly then dropping it on his foe's head, smashing their skull, neck, and spine to the point that they break. 
	The weight of this crushing blow is comparable to an object weighing several hundreds of kilograms.
<li>	Intimidation: Strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy. Someone like at Climb's level can die from this. However, Climb survives thanks to his devotion and loyalty to Renner.
<li>	Palm of the Puppeteer: Use Ki to make a target unconscious and obey the user. Activates by touching the target's forehead.
<li>	Iron Skin: Hardens the user's skin.
<h1>- Non Canon Skills</h1>
<li>Human Killing (Mass for the Dead Only): A physical attack that has increased damage against [Human]-type foes.
<li>Magical Seal (Mass for the Dead Only): A single-target physical attack that inflicts the [Seal] effect on foe after they get hit by this skill.
<li>Percussion Aerodynamics (Mass for the Dead Only): A single-target physical attack move.
	
<li>Level evaluation (Not an official name): Specializes in evaluating the capacity of enemies. He can even classify the strength of mere humans. Sebas gauges his opponent’s strength by the potency of their ki. 
	Although it is difficult to estimate one’s strength if it is hidden by some unknown skill or magic.
<li>Ki Sense (Not an official name): Feels signals of life in his surroundings. This skill allows Sebas to sense precisely how many assassins are following him and lead them into an alleyway for them to make their move.
