							-Cocytus is the weapon master of Nazarick - with his four arms, he is capable of expertly wielding any of his 21 different weapons. Being the Floor Guardian of the 5th Floor, he is an extremely powerful Guardian. 
							He bears tremendous resistance to frost attacks belonging to the ice element.
                            He also holds some power over ice due to his Knight of Niflheim job class. In addition to that, he has the ability to perceive if someone has his attention directly focused on him. On the other hand,
							 he is able to make use of his tail as an offensive weapon to sweep or knock his enemies away when they attempt to attack him from behind.
							From the perspective of a weapon user, his attacks are the strongest in Nazarick. In other words, according to Ainz, Cocytus is said to possess the greatest attack power when using a weapon.
							 This coincides with the fact that his skill and ability are entirely specialized in the use of various weapons.
							In addition, Cocytus' exoskeleton is also his armor, which could be strengthened with the increase of his level and the use of data crystal. At the same time, it possesses resistance against fire.
							 The good thing about Cocytus' weaponized body is the convenience of not needing to replace the equipment should it be damaged as it would be repaired when his HP is restored. 
							 It wouldn’t drop upon death like normal equipment and it provides Cocytus with many benefits. While so, his defenses cannot be breached by someone whose level is below him.
							However, the drawback is also apparent. His exoskeleton's hardness, toughness, and other stats are comparatively lower than player equipment of a similar level. 
							It is almost impossible for a level 100 weaponized body like Cocytus' to reach the stats of divine level equipment.
							In the Sorcerer Kingdom, Cocytus's scope of work has increased by a wide margin. He is now in charge of commanding, managing, and training the Sorcerer Kingdom’s army,
							 which consists mostly of the undead, but also includes various types of demi-humans and a small number of humans.
