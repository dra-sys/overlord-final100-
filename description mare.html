							-Mare is a powerful druid who can cast spells that support his fellow companions or control nature. Similar to Shalltear,
							 Mare is also known to have approximate statistics which are quite balanced in both physical and magical aspects of his power. For instance, when he was fighting alongside Aura against the Primal Fire Elemental, 
							 Mare had cast all sorts of buffs and debuffs to great effect during the battle. This was done so in order to prevent his sister Aura from losing HP even while fighting the high-level entity and sustaining damage by it.
							  When working together with Aura, Mare plays as a rear guard perfectly, with flawless teamwork as a pair.
                            An example of his extraordinary strength is when he crushed Igvarge's skull in with his staff. Through his magical power, 
							Mare is even able to manipulate the vegetation as snares to securely bound the enemy's body within the environment.
							Among the many spells he can cast, Mare is able to use the stealth-enhancing magic kind on himself and allies. 
							Additionally, he uses his skills to increase the effectiveness of his spells, as well as with his other class skills to maximize their range or radius.
							While so, Sebas notes how Mare's strength can compete for first and second place with Shalltear interchangeably. 
							Unlike Shalltear, who is a warrior optimized for one on one close combat individually, Mare is a magic caster optimized to deal with multiple enemies (mobs) such as armies 
							simultaneously from afar. Particularly, Shalltear describes Mare as a being who possesses the strongest area-of-effect (AoE) spells in terms of power throughout all of Nazarick.
							Due to Mare's magic, the village on the 6th Floor is kept neatly immaculate, organized, and clean. Furthermore, Mare can use his magic to produce simple stonework.
							 Mare can even create rain and restore the earth's nutrients with his magic.
							In the Sorcerer Kingdom, Mare's scope of work has increased by a wide margin and he is now in charge of controlling the weather in the territories, 
							building an underground tomb on the outskirts of E-Rantel, and working alongside the newly established Adventurer's Guild.
