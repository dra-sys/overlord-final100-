									 <b> Cocytus  </b> (コキュートス) is a Floor Guardian of the 5th Floor in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. He is the creation of Warrior Takemikazuchi.
										Having an enormous body size of 2.5 meters, Cocytus has the appearance of an insect walking on two feet - a fusion between a mantis and an ant. 
										With a tail twice as long as his height, Cocytus is covered in sharp spikes like icicles and has a strong jaw that can easily snap people's hands.
                                        Two of his hands hold a silver halberd, while the remaining two hands hold a mace emitting black light and a crooked shape sheath which seems to be for a broadsword. 
								        With a breathtaking cold air, the pale blue, hardened bone armor oozes out diamond dust like bright light. His shoulders and back look like uplifted icebergs.
										Cocytus has a warrior personality, respecting anyone with a fighting spirit, and the heart of a warrior. As a Floor Guardian, he is in charge of Nazarick's martial defense.
										 Cocytus is loyal to a fault that he even allows his master to fight the rebel Shalltear alone as the former was ordered to do. 
										This is shown when he prevented Demiurge, under Ainz's order, from interfering in Ainz's fight against Shalltear, even though he too also feared the possibility of losing his master.

                                 Although he is not one of the Floor Guardians, his power closely rivals theirs. 
								 In a way, he is independent of their chain of command. He originally served as Nazarick's last line of defense alongside the Pleiades on the 9th Floor, 
								 to give time for the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, to prepare for their final stand in the Throne Room.
								 n his human form, Sebas Tian has the appearance of an elderly butler and he is dressed gracefully in his traditional black uniform. Sebas' hair is entirely white, just like his immaculate beard. 
								 He has visible wrinkles on his hollow face, which makes him seem gentle in appearance, but his eyes are as sharp as an eagle's.
								  However, in the manga, his beard is longer, his shoulders are not as broad </div>
